I am a research assistant in [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University), working with [Prof. Yiyi Liao](https://yiyiliao.github.io/). Before that, I was a computer vision engineer at [Tiktok, ByteDance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok). I received my M.E. degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Nong Sang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ky_ZowEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and received the B.E. degree from HUST in 2017.

My research interest lies in **3D computer vision**, including **neural rendering**, **3d generative models for humans** and **in-the-wild objects**.
 <!-- My past research also involves building human-level intelligent systems, including 3D human pose and shape estimation, 2d human pose estimation and crowd counting. -->
<!-- My research interest lies in neural rendering, including 3d-aware generative model for human and in the wild objects. -->

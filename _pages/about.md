I am a second year Ph.D student in [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Polytechnic_University), supervised by [Prof. Bing Wang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-wang-bing/). Before that, I was a computer vision engineer at [AiLab, ByteDance]. I received my M.E. degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Nong Sang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ky_ZowEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and received the B.E. degree from HUST in 2017.

My research interest lies in **3D computer vision**, including **Feed-forward 3D&4D Reconstruction** and **Geometric Diffusion Model**.
 <!-- My past research also involves building human-level intelligent systems, including 3D human pose and shape estimation, 2d human pose estimation and crowd counting. -->
<!-- My research interest lies in neural rendering, including 3d-aware generative model for human and in the wild objects. -->
